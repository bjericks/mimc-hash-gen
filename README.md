MiMC Hash Generator
=======================

This project is a Chisel generator that implements the [MiMC hash function](https://byt3bit.github.io/primesym/mimc/)
with parameterized IO bit-width and number of rounds enacted on the input to produce the output hash. A simple modular
multiplier performs the round function, but you may replace the multiplier with another multiplier module to further
optimize performance.

To test the functionality of the MiMC hash generator, simply run the included tests with
```sh
sbt test
```

## Project Components

### MiMC Model

A Scala implementation of the MiMC hash function was created to compare with the Chisel implementation for testing.
The MiMC model is loosely based on an existing [Python implementation](https://wordpress-434650-1388715.cloudwaysapps.com/developers-community/hash-challenge/hash-challenge-implementation-reference-code/#marvellous) of the MiMC hash function.

### Modular Multiplier

A standard IO is implemented in the modular multiplier to facilitate interfacing with the hash generator:
* (a, b): Input(UInt): The arguments for multiplication
* out: Valid(UInt): The result of modular multiplication (a * b % m). The modulus is set within a parameter of the module.
The "valid" output signals when the operation is complete to facilitate multi-cycle multipliers.

The current implementation uses Chisel operators to calculate the result. Future implementations may apply more complex
multiplication algorithms to improve performace.

### MiMC Hash Generator



<!-- You've done the [Chisel Bootcamp](https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel-bootcamp), and now you
are ready to start your own Chisel project.  The following procedure should get you started
with a clean running [Chisel3](https://www.chisel-lang.org/) project.

## Make your own Chisel3 project

### Dependencies

#### JDK 8 or newer

We recommend LTS releases Java 8 and Java 11. You can install the JDK as recommended by your operating system, or use the prebuilt binaries from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

#### SBT

SBT is the most common built tool in the Scala community. You can download it [here](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html).

### How to get started

#### Create a repository from the template

This repository is a Github template. You can create your own repository from it by clicking the green `Use this template` in the top right.
Please leave `Include all branches` **unchecked**; checking it will pollute the history of your new repository.
For more information, see ["Creating a repository from a template"](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

#### Wait for the template cleanup workflow to complete

After using the template to create your own blank project, please wait a minute or two for the `Template cleanup` workflow to run which will removes some template-specific stuff from the repository (like the LICENSE).
Refresh the repository page in your browser until you see a 2nd commit by `actions-user` titled `Template cleanup`.


#### Clone your repository

Once you have created a repository from this template and the `Template cleanup` workflow has completed, you can click the green button to get a link for cloning your repository.
Note that it is easiest to push to a repository if you set up SSH with Github, please see the [related documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh). SSH is required for pushing to a Github repository when using two-factor authentication.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:bjericks/mimc-hash-gen.git
cd mimc-hash-gen
```

#### Set project organization and name in build.sbt

The cleanup workflow will have attempted to provide sensible defaults for `ThisBuild / organization` and `name` in the `build.sbt`.
Feel free to use your text editor of choice to change them as you see fit.

#### Clean up the README.md file

Again, use you editor of choice to make the README specific to your project.

#### Add a LICENSE file

It is important to have a LICENSE for open source (or closed source) code.
This template repository has the Unlicense in order to allow users to add any license they want to derivative code.
The Unlicense is stripped when creating a repository from this template so that users do not accidentally unlicense their own work.

For more information about a license, check out the [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/building-a-strong-community/adding-a-license-to-a-repository).

#### Commit your changes
```sh
git commit -m 'Starting mimc-hash-gen'
git push origin main
```

### Did it work?

You should now have a working Chisel3 project.

You can run the included test with:
```sh
sbt test
```

You should see a whole bunch of output that ends with something like the following lines
```
[info] Tests: succeeded 1, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0
[info] All tests passed.
[success] Total time: 5 s, completed Dec 16, 2020 12:18:44 PM
```
If you see the above then...

### It worked!

You are ready to go. We have a few recommended practices and things to do.

* Use packages and following conventions for [structure](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Directories.html) and [naming](http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/naming-conventions.html)
* Package names should be clearly reflected in the testing hierarchy
* Build tests for all your work
* Read more about testing in SBT in the [SBT docs](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Testing.html)
* This template includes a [test dependency](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Library-Dependencies.html#Per-configuration+dependencies) on [chiseltest](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chisel-testers2), this is a reasonable starting point for most tests
  * You can remove this dependency in the build.sbt file if you want to
* Change the name of your project in the build.sbt file
* Change your README.md
